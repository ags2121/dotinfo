title: In One Ear and Out the Other

description: Where does the sound go when it gets inside your ears? For centuries philosophers and thinkers have puzzled over the nature of human perception &#x2014; and in more recent times, neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists have sought to map out how our brains perform the functions that let us perceive and understand the world around us. Take a bizarre trip inside the brain of Danish documentary producer Tim Hinman, as he does his best to follow the pathways of cognition to the source &#x2014; only to be confronted with a stranger and stranger inner universe.
