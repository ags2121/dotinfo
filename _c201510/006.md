        <itunes:summary>This hour we explore nearly a decade's worth of work from Canadian sound artist, musician and radio producer Sarah Boothroyd.

        Gleeful Barbarians
        by Sarah Boothroyd (Short Cuts, BBC Radio 4, 2012)
        An audio postcard from the often joyful, sometimes exasperating, and always busy world of early parenthood. Featuring very silly noises, nearly-indecipherable toddler chitchat, and 27 different ways a two-year-old can say 'no.'

        Do What You Fear And Fear Disappears
        by Sarah Boothroyd (Third Coast International Audio Festival Short Docs Challenge, 2006)
        Screams, thoughts on fear, screams, spooky music, more screams.

        Rabble Rousers
        by Sarah Boothroyd (Ontario Arts Council, 2012)
        Touching on ethics, justice, democracy, and global citizenship, Rabble Rousers explores the notion of protest as a spontaneous installation of improvised 'music' in public space.

        Forest To Desert
        by Sarah Boothroyd (Third Coast International Audio Festival Short Docs Challenge, 2008)
        An audio doodle about this phrase: 'Humankind is preceded by forest, and followed by desert.'

        Through a Door
        by Sarah Boothroyd (CBC Radio and New Adventures In Sound Art, 2008)
        A soundscape about the Nicholas Street Jail in Ottawa, a structure described by a jail inspector in 1946 as 'a monstrous relic of an imperfect civilization where cells are medieval, incredibly cramped, with conditions far below the limits of human decency.'

        Chance
        by Sarah Boothroyd (Between The Ears, BBC Radio 3, 2013)
        Turn right and you meet the man or woman of your dreams. Turn left and you get hit by a car. Much of life is a matter of being in the right place at the right time, or the wrong place at the wrong time. This impressionistic audio work explores randomness, chance, and luck through the microcosm of the racetrack.</itunes:summary>
