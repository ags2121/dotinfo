title: Music, Memory, and Auditory Angels
description: "Without music we’d simply be something other than human beings.” Birthdays, weddings, festivals, funerals and more – pretty much every important human event is marked by music, and our brains take it all in, no matter how distant or vague those memories become. In this episode we meet Paul Robertson, violinist and professor in music and medicine, who has spent years working with people suffering from dementia and brain damage. We discover how the music embedded in memories and dreams can be accessed in people whose fabric of identity has come under stress in order to help them find their way back to themselves.
