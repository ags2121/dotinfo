# Summary
Publicradio.info is a place for listening to noncommercial news, culture, and art. It includes:

1. A monthly, handpicked collection of podcast items, playable on the [homepage](http://www.publicradio.info) and through an [RSS feed](http://publicradio.info/feed.xml).

2. A list of leading news and analysis podcasts, of which the most recent episodes are playable on the [homepage](http://www.publicradio.info).

# Purpose
Create a space for people to discover and experience audio. Contributors work to develop a decent web experience of good and unusual sounds, incl. news, analysis, music mixes, documentaries, comedies, investigative reports, stories, and audio experiments. Publicradio.info exists to highlight independent, noncommercial, listener-supported radio, and also to encourage consumers to become active supporters of public media. Content and other things for the homepage and podcast come monthly, as in a small audio magazine or mixtape.

# Content
Content is sourced from **dotinfo/_cYYYYMM/** and **dotinfo/_data/** folders.

Monthly podcast items (`Main Program`, `Selected Audio`, `Playlist`) come from Markdown files located in the **_cYYYYMM** folder. They adhere to this syntax:

```Markdown

  date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (our own publishing date)
  image: http://….png (only necessary if main program)
  
  audio: http://….mp3

```

News items (`News & Analysis`) are served by a separate aggregating service. The code for the service lives in the [public-radio-services](https://github.com/ags2121/public-radio-services) github repo. News podcasts with static urls can bypass the service and be hardcoded in **feeds.yml** in the **_data** folder. They adhere to this syntax:

```YAML
- title: TITLE OF PROGRAM [HH:MM:SS]
  frequency: UPDATE RATE
  audio: http://….mp3 (leave blank if news resource is served by the public-radio-services)
  type: TYPE
```
