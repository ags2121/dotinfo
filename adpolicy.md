# General Policy on Advertising
[PublicRadio.info](http://www.publicradio.info) strives to give users a 100% ad-free audio experience.

The FCC, which governs publicly owned airwaves in the U.S., rules: "No public broadcast station may make its facilities available to any person for the broadcasting of any advertisement." We think these guidelines should apply to creators of noncommercial educational media on the internet, too. "Advertising" is defined (in [Section 399B of the Communications Act of 1934](https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/nature-of-educational-broadcasting)) as:

>any message or other programming material which is broadcast or otherwise transmitted
>in exchange for any remuneration, and which is intended —
> (1) to promote any service, facility, or product offered by any person who is engaged in
>such offering for profit;
> (2) to express the views of any person with respect to any matter of public importance or
>interest; or
> (3) to support or oppose any candidate for political office.

On our radio streams and podcasts you may hear: calls for donations, fundraising drives, announcements regarding public radio content or events, and/or underwriting spots.

Underwriting spots—unlike ads—are short, neutral, non-promotional messages that identify private sponsors of public radio content for an informational purpose only. These messages may include basic information about a company (website, address, an identifying slogan), but should _not_ promote that company's goods or services. For example, an underwriting message should not include: endorsements, testimonials, specific product prices or descriptions, calls to purchase, or coupon codes.
